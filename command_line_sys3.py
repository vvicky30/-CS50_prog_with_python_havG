Command Line Arguments  [sys.argv] here argv tands for argumrnt-vector
Command-line arguments are those which are passed during the calling of the program along with the calling statement. 
To achieve this using the sys module, the sys module provides a variable called sys.argv. Itâ€™s main purpose are:

It is a list of command-line arguments.
len(sys.argv) provides the number of command-line arguments.
sys.argv[0] is where it stores the name of the current Python script.
sys.argv[1 to n] stores whatever user pass through commandline while executing python-script

Example: Consider a program for adding numbers and 
the numbers are passed along with the calling statement.

This code calculates the sum of the command-line arguments passed to the Python script. 
It imports the sys module to access the command-line arguments and then iterates over the arguments, converting each one to an integer 
and adding it to a running total. Finally,it prints the total sum of the arguments.

on console (o/p):-

so here is the total numbers you entered: 6 
here are those number you entered: ['1', '8', '6', '7', '3', '9']
here we're iterating over your entered C-L-arguments/values:-

here is your 1-ELE: 1
here is your 2-ELE: 8
here is your 3-ELE: 6

here is your 5-ELE: 3
here is your 6-ELE: 9
total sum of the C-L-values is: 34
