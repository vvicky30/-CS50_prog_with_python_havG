    "1. Encapsulation: Classes encapsulate data for the object they create, along with methods (functions) that operate on that data. This helps in organizing and structuring code.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Inheritance: One of the pillars of OOP, inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and allows for hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Polymorphism: This allows methods to do different things based on the object that calls them. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading."
