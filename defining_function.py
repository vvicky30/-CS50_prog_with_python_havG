#where we're going to call several fns defined out of the main-fn by passing relevent arguments,parameters/var
#we're going to define our own sets or chains of fns out of the main-fn all with their operational definitions and with their functional parameters (optional parameters, necesaary parameters with default values etc), and then going to return the final furnished o/p from respective fns to corresponding functional call in main-fns
