    "### Inheritance in Python\n",
    "One of the core concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages is inheritance. It is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class. Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of inheritance are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows you to inherit the properties of a class, i.e., base class to another, i.e., derived class. The benefits of Inheritance in Python are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance. \n",
